Welcome to the database of NAMPI.

This website allows you to research in the content created by the *Project Nuns and Monks - Prosopographical Interfaces*, funded as part of the [go!digital NEXT GENERATION](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/foerderungen/foerderprogramme/subsites/godigital/godigital-next-generation-projects) programme of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The website has been created using the [NAMPI data backend](https://github.com/nam-pi/backend) as well as the accompanying [webapp](https://github.com/nam-pi/frontend). Both have been developed as part of the NAMPI-Project and are freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nam-pi).
